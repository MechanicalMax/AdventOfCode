# AdventOfCode
Advent of Code is a daily two-part challenge in the 25 days leading to Christmas.
I started in 2021 when I first began learning computer science independently.

By staying curious and solving these puzzles, I have expanded my algorithms toolkit
and grown more comfortable with competitive coding environments.

I would not have the same software development skills today without the challenge
and creativity of these puzzles (https://adventofcode.com/).

---

Starting in 2024, I branched out from Python to C# to become more comfortable programming 
in Unity and game development.

Here's to another month of programming challenges!

Stay creative and keep making ~

## Program Map
The **AoCSupport** Solution contains helper classes for getting input,
organizing each day's puzzle, and running each day in a similar formatted
output. The other solutions in the format of **AoC20XX** contain my puzzle
input and the code I used to solve the problems.

## Challenge Summary
Below is a list of days I could not solve the problem independently.
References and code sources are in line with the puzzles in the comments.
