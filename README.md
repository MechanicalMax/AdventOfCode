# AdventOfCode
Advent of Code is a daily two-part challenge in the 25 days leading to Christmas.
I started in 2021 when I first began learning computer science independently.

By staying curious and solving these puzzles, I have expanded my algorithms toolkit
and grown more comfortable with competitive coding environments.

I would not have the same software development skills today without the challenge
and creativity of these puzzles (https://adventofcode.com/).

Starting in 2024, I branched out from Python to C# to become more comfortable programming 
in Unity and game development.

Here's to another month of programming challenges!

Stay creative and keep making ~

The **AdventOfCode** Solution contains a class library of helper functions
and templates (**AoCSupport**) for each of the individual year projects.
